Feedbackwall 

With this activity the students can give the course/teacher 
a short feedback, new thing is that those feedbacks are 
public (on a "wall") and if the students choose so, anonymously.
A feedback can also be commented and by that a little conversion 
could also be possible.

Anonymously means that the author of a feedback would be Anonymous. 
Rating a feedback isnt anonymous.
