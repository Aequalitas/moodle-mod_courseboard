Courseboard by Franz Weidmann

With this activity the students can give the course/teacher 
a short feedback, new thing is that those posts are public (on a "wall") and if the students
choose so, anonymously and that in a quick way(short text, without much clicking).
A post can also be commented and by that a little discussion could also be possible.
In the end, this plugin should enhance the communication between student and teacher, but student to student too.

Anonymously means that the author of a post would be Anonymous.
Rating a post isnt anonymous.
